**Project Description**
<br>
Single deck blackjack game with the ability to bet and lose "money" vs the dealer. User starts off with set amount of money, can type in the bet amount and keep track of wins/losses.




*MVP Goals*
<br>
As a player I would like the game to have interactive input boxes and buttons.
<br>
As a player I would like to be able to keep track of my money, as well as how much i've gained or lost.
<br>
As a player I would like to be able to double down on my hand.
<br>
As a player I would like to know when I have won or lost
<br>

*Stretch Goals*
<br>
Add decks up to 6 (standard blackjack) as well as have multiple players
<br>
Have special rules/bets such as same suite or pairs for extra odds.
<br>
Have a split option for pairs. 
<br>



*Problems/Hurdles*
Figuring out the logic behind aces proved to be quite difficult. 
<br>
Still working on adding split function.
<br>
Adding more decks is actually easy and just a swap of some words in the API fetch, decided against adding for now.
<br>
the Wallet and tracking bets functions are still not as smooth as i'd like.
